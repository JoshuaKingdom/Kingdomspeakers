        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Joshua. I am passionate about community, inclusiveness, and safe spaces for everyone. I turned my passion into purpose by completing certifications and becoming a Leadership Coach, D.E.I. Ambassador, Community Advocate, and Motivational Speaker. I have personal and professional experience helping leaders, teams, and organizations evolve to their next level of growth. With my knowledge of creativity, determination, and collaboration, I’ve had the opportunity to lead cultural lunches and learns, organize safe space panels, plan educational virtual and in-person events, launch training programs, and be a Guest Speaker at corporate events to discuss various topics such as representation, intersectionality, and LGBTQIA leadership. I walked alongside senior leadership, supporting them with effectively updating onboarding and hiring processes to be more inclusive.
